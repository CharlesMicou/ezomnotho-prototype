# ezomnotho-prototype
Agent-based computational economics prototype.

### tl;dr?

Ezomnotho is a prototype of an agent-based computational economics simulation.


### FAQ

##### Why are you building this?

I had a daydream about building an arbitrage-style, medieval-merchant-themed game on the SpatialOS platform.
The game wouldn't be fun if the underlying NPC economy lacked depth, so I thought I'd prototype some ideas for agent behaviour within an economy first.
SpatialOS is not an ideal platform for prototyping algorithms, so I started getting some ideas down in an isolated environemnt, and, well, this project happened.

##### Why is the project called Ezomnotho?

I plugged the word "economics" into Google Translate and selected languages until I found something that sounded cool. It's impossible to spell and it's going to be the bane of searching this project; woops.

##### How much do you know about economics simulations?

Absolutely nothing.
