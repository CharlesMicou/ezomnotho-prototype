# ezomnotho-prototype
Agent-based computational economics prototype.

### tl;dr?

Ezomnotho is a prototype of an agent-based computational economics simulation.


### FAQ

##### Why are you building this?

I want to build a arbitrage-style, merchant-themed game on the SpatialOS platform.
The game won't be fun if the underlying economy lacks depth.
SpatialOS is not an ideal platform for prototyping algorithms, so I'm prototyping them
here first.

##### Why is the project called Ezomnotho?

I plugged the word "economics" into Google Translate and selected languages until I found something that sounded cool. It's Zulu.

##### How much do you know about economics simulations?

Absolutely nothing.
